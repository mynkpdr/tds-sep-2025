# 8. Use GitHub Copilot CLI (1 Mark)

## 1. Problem Description

This task requires using the official **GitHub Copilot CLI** to generate a Python script. The goal is to instruct Copilot to create a file named `prime.py` that calculates and prints the 10th prime number. The final submission is the full, unmodified log file generated by the Copilot CLI during this process.

## 2. Understanding the Requirements

* **Tool**: GitHub Copilot CLI (`@github/copilot`).
* **Task**: Generate a Python file (`prime.py`) that prints the 10th prime number.
* **Execution**: The CLI must be run with specific flags to enable logging (`--log-dir ./logs` and `--log-level debug`).
* **Submission**: The entire content of the timestamped log file created in the `./logs` directory.

## 3. Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Prerequisites**:
    * Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm`) installed on your system.
    * You must have an active GitHub Copilot subscription on your GitHub account.

2. **Create a Project Directory**:
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Create a new folder for this project and navigate into it.

        ```bash
        mkdir copilot-task
        cd copilot-task
        ```

3. **Authenticate (if first time)**:
    * The first time you use the Copilot CLI, it will ask you to authenticate. Run `npx @github/copilot` and follow the on-screen instructions to log in with your GitHub account.

4. **Construct and Run the Command**:
    * The problem requires a specific command structure. We need to combine the `npx` command with the tool name, logging flags, and the prompt.
    * **The prompt**: `'Create a new file called prime.py that calculates and prints the 10th prime number.'`
    * **The full command**:

        ```bash
        npx -y @github/copilot --log-dir ./logs --allow-all-tools --log-level debug -p "Create a new file called prime.py that calculates and prints the 10th prime number."
        ```

    * Run this command in your terminal from inside the `copilot-task` directory.

5. **Let Copilot Work**:
    * Copilot will process the request. It might ask for confirmation before creating the file. Approve its plan.
    * After it finishes, you should see a new `prime.py` file in your directory, and a new `logs` directory will have been created.

6. **Locate and Copy the Log File**:
    * Navigate into the `logs` directory. You will find a file with a name like `bc3e71da-......txt`.
    * Open the newest log file with a text editor.
    * Select all the text and copy it to your clipboard.

7. **Submit**:
    * Paste the entire log content as your answer. If it says `Log is missing expected marker: /gh auth token/i` just add the line `gh auth token`

## 4. Code / Configuration File (The Command)

This is the exact command you need to run in your terminal.

```bash
npx -y @github/copilot --log-dir ./logs --allow-all-tools --log-level debug -p "Create a new file called prime.py that calculates and prints the 10th prime number."
`````

After running the command, you can verify the generated Python script:

**`prime.py` (Example Output)**

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find the 10th prime number
nth_prime = find_nth_prime(10)
print(nth_prime) # The 10th prime is 29
```

## 5. How to Verify

The primary verification is done on the log file you submit. Before submitting, you can quickly check if it's correct:

1. **File Exists**: Make sure a log file was actually created in the `./logs` folder.
2. **Content Check**: Open the file. It should be a long text file containing:
    * Timestamps (e.g., `2025-10-04T...`).
    * Debug messages (e.g., `[DEBUG]`).
    * References to `GitHub` and `copilot`.

If your log file contains this kind of detailed information, it is the correct file to submit.
