# 9. Execute a Bash Pipeline with the `llm` CLI Tool (0.5 Marks)

## 1. Problem Description

The task is to write a single, complete **bash pipeline command** that uses Simon Willison's `llm` command-line tool to perform a specific task. The command will be evaluated for its correctness and ability to accomplish the goal using standard Unix pipeline features (`|`).

## 2. Understanding the Requirements

- **Tool**: Simon Willison's `llm` CLI.
- **Format**: A single-line bash command.
- **Core Logic**: The command must use a pipeline to chain at least two tools together (e.g., a data-fetching tool like `curl` and the `llm` tool).
- **Task**: The command should successfully perform the specified action (e.g., list and identify which environment variables might contain sensitive information).

## 3. Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Install and Configure `llm`

1. **Install `llm`**: If you don't have it, install it using `pip`. You'll need Python installed.

    ```bash
    pip install llm
    ```

2. **Set API Key**: The `llm` tool needs an API key for a large language model provider (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google).

    For OpenAI:
    - Get an API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/).

    - Set the key using the `llm` command:

        ```bash
        llm keys set openai
        ```

    - Paste your key when prompted.

    For AI Pipe:
    - Get an API key from [aipipe.org](https://aipipe.org/login/).
    - Set the api base url and key using the `llm` command:

        ```bash
        llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN
        export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1
        ```

### Step 2: Plan the Pipeline

The task has two parts:

1. **Fetch the data**: List all environment variables available in the shell. The `printenv` command is the standard and reliable way to do this.
2. **Process the output**: Pipe the list of environment variables into the `llm` tool and ask it to identify which variables may contain sensitive information.

### Step 3: Construct the Command

1. **Start with listing environment variables**:

   ```bash
   printenv
   ```

2. **Pipe the output to `llm`**:

   ```bash
   printenv | llm "..."
   ```

3. **Write the `llm` prompt**: The prompt should clearly instruct the model to analyze the environment variable names (and optionally values) for sensitivity.

   ```bash
   "You will receive environment variables via stdin. Identify which ones might contain sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, tokens, passwords, secrets, or private config, and list only the variable names you believe are sensitive."
   ```

### Step 4: Finalize the Command

Combine all parts into a single line. This final command is the solution you would submit.

## 4. Code / Configuration File (The Bash Command)

This is the complete bash command to be executed in the terminal (It maybe different for your question).

```bash
printenv | llm "You will receive environment variables via stdin. Identify which ones might contain sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, tokens, passwords, secrets, or private config, and list only the variable names you believe are sensitive."
```

## 5. How to Verify

1. **Run the command**: Open your terminal (after setting up `llm` and your API key) and execute the command above.
2. **Check the output**: The command should print only the names of environment variables that the model considers potentially sensitive.

   - **Example Output**:

     ```
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
     GITHUB_TOKEN
     ```

If the command executes successfully and returns a filtered list of variable names that appear sensitive, your pipeline is working correctly.
