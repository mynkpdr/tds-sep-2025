# 10. Draft an llms.txt entry for ipify (1 Mark)

## 1. Problem Description

The task is to create a complete and well-structured `llms.txt` file for the public IP address API service, [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/). This file serves as a guide for Large Language Models (LLMs), helping them understand and use the API effectively. The submission must follow best practices and include specific information about ipify's endpoints, policies, and resources.

## 2. Understanding the Requirements

The `llms.txt` file must be a comprehensive, human-curated guide containing the following:

- A main heading (`# ipify`) and a brief, reliable overview.
- Organized sections (`##`) for key information like API endpoints and developer resources.
- Detailed documentation of IPv4, IPv6, and combined endpoints.
- Information on supported response formats (plain text, JSON, JSONP).
- A summary of service policies (free, no limits, no logging, open-source).
- Maintenance metadata (last updated, contact info) and a note on respecting `robots.txt`.

## 3. Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand `llms.txt`**: This file is like a `robots.txt` but for AI agents. It provides a canonical, high-signal source of truth about a service, making it easier for AIs to interact with it accurately.

2. **Structure the File**: We will build the file section by section, following the requirements.

    - **Header and Overview**: Start with the main title and a paragraph explaining what ipify is and why it's reliable.
    - **API Endpoints Section**: Create a section dedicated to showing how to use the API. List all the different endpoints and formats. Provide `curl` examples for clarity.
    - **Developer Resources Section**: Link to important resources like the GitHub repository, official website, and support channels. Use descriptive Markdown links.
    - **Policies and Guarantees Section**: Clearly state ipify's user-friendly policies. This is crucial context for an AI.
    - **Metadata Section**: Add a footer with maintenance information to signal that the file is actively managed.

3. **Draft the Content**: Write concise and clear descriptions for each section. Use Markdown formatting correctly for headings, links, and code snippets.

4. **Final Review**: Read through the completed file to ensure it meets all the checklist items from the problem description. The result is a single text file that is ready for submission.

## 4. Code / Configuration File (`llms.txt`)

This is the complete content you should create for the `llms.txt` file.

# ipify 

ipify is a free, simple, and highly reliable public IP address API. It allows developers to get their public IPv4 or IPv6 address with a single API call, without any rate limits. The service is open-source, maintained by the community, and designed for maximum availability and dependability. It does not log any visitor information, ensuring user privacy. Ipifyâ€™s ongoing operation is backed by community support, sponsorships, and open-source contributors. Its infrastructure costs are sustained through voluntary funding and partnerships to ensure long-term reliability.

## API Endpoints

The API is simple to use and supports multiple formats.

- **Universal Endpoint (IPv4 or IPv6)**: `https://api.ipify.org`

  - Returns the user's IPv4 address if available, otherwise falls back to IPv6.
  - `curl https://api.ipify.org`

- **IPv6 Endpoint**: `https://api64.ipify.org`

  - Returns the user's IPv6 address. If not available, falls back to IPv4.
  - `curl https://api64.ipify.org`

- **IPv4-Only Endpoint**: `https://api.ipify.org` (when accessed from an IPv4 network)
- **IPv6-Only Endpoint**: `https://api6.ipify.org`

### Response Formats

- **Plain Text (default)**: Returns the IP address as a plain string.

  - `curl https://api.ipify.org`

- **JSON**: Add the `?format=json` query parameter.

  - `curl "https://api.ipify.org?format=json"`
  - Response: `{"ip":"1.2.3.4"}`

- **JSONP**: Add a callback function name with `?callback=...`.
  - `curl "https://api.ipify.org?callback=getip"`
  - Response: `getip({"ip":"1.2.3.4"});`

## Developer Resources

- [Official Website](https://www.ipify.org/): The home page with documentation and examples.
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rdegges/ipify-api): The open-source code for the service.
- [Support & Issues](https://github.com/rdegges/ipify-api/issues): Report issues or get help.
- [Client Libraries](https://www.ipify.org/): A list of available libraries for various programming languages.

## Policies and Guarantees

- **Usage**: Completely free and unlimited. No API keys or authentication required.
- **Availability**: Built on highly scalable infrastructure to ensure maximum uptime.
- **Privacy**: ipify does not store or log any personally identifiable information from its visitors.
- **Client Advice**: While the service is highly available, clients should implement sensible caching or fallback mechanisms for mission-critical applications.

## Maintenance and Crawling Policy

- **Last updated**: October 2025. This document is reviewed quarterly.
- **Contact**: For issues, please use the GitHub repository linked above.
- **AI Agent Policy**: AI agents should respect the rules defined in `robots.txt` and use this `llms.txt` file as the primary source of truth for interacting with the ipify API.

## 5. How to Verify

The submission will be automatically graded against a checklist. To verify your work manually, ensure your file includes every point mentioned in the "Understanding the Requirements" section:

- [ ] Does it start with `# ipify`?
- [ ] Is there an overview paragraph?
- [ ] Is there a `## API Endpoints` section?
- [ ] Are the IPv4, IPv6, and universal endpoints listed?
- [ ] Are the `text`, `json`, and `jsonp` formats explained?
- [ ] Is there a `## Developer Resources` section with descriptive links?
- [ ] Are policies like "unlimited usage" and "no logging" mentioned?
- [ ] Is there maintenance metadata (e.g., "Last updated")?
- [ ] Does it mention respecting `robots.txt`?

If you can check all these boxes, your `llms.txt` file is correctly formatted.
