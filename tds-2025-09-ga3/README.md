# Summary of all the questions

### **Question 1: Vibe Code a GitHub API App**

* **What it Covered:** Writing a **prompt** for an AI model to generate the body of a **JavaScript** function. The function fetches user data from the public **GitHub API**. The key skill is prompt engineering without "spoonfeeding."
* **Why you need it:** This teaches effective communication with AI code assistants. Learning to describe *what* you want, not *how* to do it, allows the AI to generate optimal and idiomatic code, accelerating development.

### **Question 2: Vibe Code a Data Crunching App**

* **What it Covered:** Prompting an AI to generate a **JavaScript** function body that fetches a **JSON** dataset from a URL, parses it, and calculates a sum of specific values.
* **Why you need it:** This task is a classic data processing pattern: fetch, parse, and aggregate. Prompting an AI to do this efficiently teaches you how to delegate common data manipulation tasks, freeing you to focus on more complex business logic.

### **Question 3: Build and Share a Quiz App on Claude Artifacts**

* **What it Covered:** Using **Claude.ai's Artifacts** feature to create and share a live, interactive quiz application from a natural language prompt. The entire app (HTML, CSS, JS) is self-contained and shareable.
* **Why you need it:** This showcases rapid prototyping with AI. Instead of setting up a local server, you can generate, test, and share a functional web app in seconds. This is invaluable for creating quick demos and testing UI ideas.

### **Question 4: Build and Share a Quiz App on Gemini Canvas**

* **What it Covered:** Using **Google Gemini's Canvas** feature to generate, preview, and share an interactive quiz application from a prompt, resulting in a public shareable link.
* **Why you need it:** Like Claude Artifacts, this skill demonstrates the ability to use different AI platforms for rapid, interactive development. Proficiency with these integrated tools makes you a more versatile and efficient developer.

### **Question 5: Build an App Using GitHub Copilot Chat**

* **What it Covered:** Using the **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension within **VS Code** to generate an application. The key deliverable is the chat log, which documents your interaction with the AI.
* **Why you need it:** This demonstrates proficiency with the most popular AI coding assistant directly within a professional developer's IDE. It shows you know how to use conversational AI to write, refactor, and debug code in your primary workflow.

### **Question 6: Submit a Jules-Generated Pull Request**

* **What it Covered:** Using **Google's Jules AI** to author code changes in a GitHub repository and open a **Pull Request (PR)**, automating part of the development workflow.
* **Why you need it:** This moves beyond simple code generation to AI-driven workflow automation. Using an AI agent to manage branches and pull requests is the next level of automation, showing an understanding of how AI can participate in the entire development lifecycle.

### **Question 7: FastAPI + CLI Coding Agent**

* **What it Covered:** Building a **FastAPI** web service that acts as a wrapper around a command-line AI agent (**GitHub Copilot CLI**). The API takes a prompt, passes it to the CLI tool via a **subprocess**, captures the output, and returns it as JSON.
* **Why you need it:** This is a powerful pattern for building custom AI-powered tools. By wrapping a CLI tool in an API, you make its functionality accessible over the web, which is essential for creating microservices or internal developer tools.

### **Question 8: Use GitHub Copilot CLI**

* **What it Covered:** Using the **GitHub Copilot CLI** directly from the terminal to generate a script, including the use of command-line flags for logging.
* **Why you need it:** This demonstrates using AI coding assistance in a headless environment, such as a remote server or a CI/CD pipeline. Being comfortable with the CLI version of Copilot is crucial for automation, scripting, and backend development.

### **Question 9: Execute a Bash Pipeline with the `llm` CLI Tool**

* **What it Covered:** Using Simon Willison's **`llm` CLI tool** in a **bash pipeline**. This involved piping the output of one command (like `printenv`) into `llm` to be analyzed by an LLM.
* **Why you need it:** This is the "Unix philosophy" meets modern AI. It shows you can compose powerful, single-line commands by combining simple, standard tools with the reasoning capabilities of an LLM for efficient command-line data processing.

### **Question 10: Draft an llms.txt entry for ipify**

* **What it Covered:** Creating a **`llms.txt`** file for a public API. This file acts as a high-quality, human-curated guide for AI agents, explaining how to use the API correctly and reliably.
* **Why you need it:** As AI agents become more autonomous, they need reliable instructions. `llms.txt` is an emerging standard for API providers to guide AI interactions, and knowing how to create one shows an understanding of the AI agent ecosystem.

### **Question 11: Ship a Jules-Authored Test Workflow**

* **What it Covered:** Using **Google's Jules AI** to perform an end-to-end development task: write a Python function, create a corresponding test suite using **`pytest`**, and set up a **GitHub Actions** workflow to run those tests automatically.
* **Why you need it:** This is a comprehensive demonstration of AI-driven development and Test-Driven Development (TDD). It shows you can instruct an AI agent to write functional code and ensure its quality with automated testing, a highly valuable skill for MLOps and DevOps roles.
