# 2. LLM Token Cost (0.5 Marks)

## 1. Problem Description

The task is to determine the exact number of "input tokens" an AI model (`gpt-4o-mini`) consumes when processing a specific user message. AI models don't see words; they see "tokens," which can be words, parts of words, or punctuation. Accurately counting tokens is crucial for managing API costs.

## 2. Understanding the Requirements

- **Input**: A specific user message provided in the question.
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini`.
- **Calculation**: You must find the total number of input tokens.
- **Hidden Factor**: The total token count includes not only the tokens from the text itself but also a few extra tokens that the API uses to structure the message (e.g., to specify that it's a `user` role message).

## 3. Step-by-Step Solution

The most reliable way to get the exact token count is to use OpenAI's official Tokenizer tool.

1. **Copy the Text**: Go to the question page and carefully copy the entire user message provided in the `<pre>` block. Make sure to get the text exactly as it appears, including any strange characters or spacing.

2. **Open the Tokenizer**: Navigate to OpenAI's official Tokenizer tool in your web browser:
   [https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)

3. **Select the Model**: On the Tokenizer page, find the model selection dropdown and choose `GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini`. This is important because different models count tokens differently.

4. **Paste the Text**: Paste the text you copied into the large text box on the Tokenizer page.

5. **Count the Text Tokens**: The tool will instantly display the number of tokens for the text you pasted. For example, it might say "465 tokens" (It's not the answer).

6. **Add Overhead Tokens**: An API call is not just the text; it's structured data. This structure adds a small number of overhead tokens. For `gpt-4o-mini`, a single user message adds **7 extra tokens**.

7. **Calculate the Final Total**:
   - `Total Tokens = (Tokens from Tokenizer) + 7`
   - For example, if the tokenizer showed 465 tokens, the final answer would be `465 + 7 = 472`.

8. **Submit the Answer**: Enter the final calculated number into the answer box.

## 4. Code / Configuration File

This question requires a single number as the answer, not code. The process involves using an external tool.

**Example Calculation:**

- **Given Text**: `List only the valid English words from these: Lg, xbGxgMTl...`
- **Step 1**: Paste this text into the OpenAI Tokenizer (with `gpt-4o-mini` selected). Let's assume it shows **465 tokens**.
- **Step 2**: Add the API overhead of **7 tokens**.
- **Final Answer**: `465 + 7 = 472`.

## 5. How to Verify

You can verify your answer by ensuring you have followed the steps correctly:

- The correct model (`gpt-4o-mini`) was selected in the tokenizer.
- The text was copied and pasted exactly, without any modifications.
- You correctly added the 7 overhead tokens to the count from the tokenizer tool.
  The platform will check if your submitted number matches the pre-calculated correct answer.
